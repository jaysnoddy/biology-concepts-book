Concepts of Biological Systems is derived from *Concepts of Biology*, an OpenStax resource. The modifications in this textbook is intended to be in the spirit of the original Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license and will remain so licensed.  Please see the original project from which this forked to see more about this project.

### About OpenStax   {#eip-723}

OpenStax is a non-profit organization committed to improving student access to quality learning materials. Their free textbooks are developed and peer-reviewed by educators to ensure they are readable, accurate, and meet the scope and sequence requirements of today’s college courses. Unlike traditional textbooks, OpenStax resources live online and are owned by the community of educators using them. Through our partnerships with companies and foundations committed to reducing costs for students, OpenStax is working to improve access to higher education for all. OpenStax is an initiative of Rice University and is made possible through the generous support of several philanthropic foundations.


#### Curation   {#eip-912}

To broaden access and encourage community curation, both the *Concepts of Biology* and the derivative *Concepts of Biological Systems* are “open source” licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license. The scientific community is invited to use content accordly.

#### Customization, Collaboration. and Attribution   {#eip-189}

OpenStax learning resources were designed to be customized for each course. Instructors have an option of creating a customized version of their OpenStax book. These Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) licenses specifically allows remixes. To customize this book for my use as part of a larger effort--but also promote both collaboration and attribution--I shall try to do this customization in two stages.  The first stage is to modify and extend this content within this git fork. This will largely retain this general outline.  This will allow anyone to see--or merge--any of my changes they wish, but within an overall familar framework.  If I do adequate commit messages and use the git technology correctly, it should be clear what work remains of the original authors. Moreover, if I commit an error, then that also will be clear. I shall probably not create pull requests, as my edits will largely be for a different audience and purpose.   The second stage of customization would be to use some of the modified text within a different outline of my devising in a remix that mixes in other content of mine, other authors, or open content. The attribution to the original work will be explicit in this remix, but also point to this git fork for more detailed accounting of my reliance on original authors.  I trust this is in the sprit of both the orignal license and in the spirit of academic integrity. If anyone has any concerns or comments, please feel free to contact me. 

* Unit 1: **The Cellular Foundation of Life**. Our opening unit introduces students to the sciences, including the process of science and the underlying concepts from the physical sciences that provide a framework within which learners comprehend biological processes. Additionally, students will gain solid understanding of the structures, functions, and processes of the most basic unit of life: the cell.
* Unit 2: **Cell Division and Genetics**. Our genetics unit takes learners from the foundations of cellular reproduction to the experiments that revealed the basis of genetics and laws of inheritance.
* Unit 3: **Molecular Biology and Biotechnology**. Students will learn the intricacies of DNA, protein synthesis, and gene regulation and current applications of biotechnology and genomics.
* Unit 4: **Evolution and the Diversity of Life**. The core concepts of evolution are discussed in this unit with examples illustrating evolutionary processes. Additionally, the evolutionary basis of biology reappears throughout the textbook in general discussion and is reinforced through special call-out features highlighting specific evolution-based topics. The diversity of life is explored with detailed study of various organisms and discussion of emerging phylogenetic relationships between and among bacteria, protist kingdoms, fungi, plants, and animals.
* Unit 5: **Animal Structure and Function**. An introduction to the form and function of the animal body is followed by chapters on the immune system and animal development. This unit touches on the biology of all organisms while maintaining an engaging focus on human anatomy and physiology that helps students connect to the topics.
* Unit 6: **Ecology**. Ecological concepts are broadly covered in this unit, with features highlighting localized, real-world issues of conservation and biodiversity. 

#### Pedagogical Foundation and Features   {#eip-443}

* **Evolution in Action** features uphold the importance of evolution to all biological study through discussions like “Global Decline of Coral Reefs” and “The Red Queen Hypothesis.”
* **Career in Action** features present information on a variety of careers in the biological sciences, introducing students to the educational requirements and day-to-day work life of a variety of professions, such as forensic scientists, registered dietitians, and biogeographers.
* **Biology in Action** features tie biological concepts to emerging issues and discuss science in terms of everyday life. Topics include “Invasive Species” and “Photosynthesis at the Grocery Store.”
